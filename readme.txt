Petals has been designed to be easy to set up, and can be done so directly from the Customizer. Pick your own header image and visit the "Theme Options" panel. You can also create a Promotion Panel or create a Block directly from your Customizer to direct your audience to significant parts of your website. If you wish, you can toggle your front-page to something bolder in the Front Page Panel. From there, all you need to do is write your first post.
