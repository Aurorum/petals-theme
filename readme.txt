== Description ==

== Installation ==

3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set up my theme? =

Petals has been designed to be easy to set up, and can be done so directly from the Customizer. Pick your own header image and visit the "Theme Options" panel, from which you can also create a Promotion Panel. If you wish, you can also toggle your front-page to something bolder in the Front Page Panel. In order to utilise "Blocks", which emphasise certain content and provide the ability to link to other content, you'll need to activate a Static Front Page, then visit the Customizer. From there, all that's left to do is to start blogging!

= Does this theme support any plugins? =

Petals includes support for Jetpack's Infinite Scrolling, Social Menu, and Content Options. It is also compatible with all Gutenberg blocks.
